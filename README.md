How to test with MySQL?
First, you create a specific database for it (next tasks). After, you have to remember what the purpose of an unittest?

“Assert a current state (objects/data/database), do an action, and validate this action changed (or not) the state of your objects/data/database”

For example, “you want to validate that the create State name="California" command in the console will add a new record in your table states in your database”, here steps for your unittest:

get the number of current records in the table states (my using a MySQLdb for example - but not SQLAlchemy (remember, you want to test if it works, so it’s better to isolate from the system))
execute the console command
get (again) the number of current records in the table states (same method, with MySQLdb)
if the difference is +1 => test passed
